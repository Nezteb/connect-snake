# Connect Snake

An implementation of the game Snake inspired by the classic Connect Four game.

## Background

This is the sourcecode for connect-snake.brahmlower.io, a project inspired by [this gif](https://imgur.com/gallery/GBrEM) I saw on Imgur the other day. Frontend development is not my preferred area of software development, so please excuse the horrible javascript. This project was thrown together with no real planning :)


## Building

Run the following to add this to your project:

```
npm install git+https://github.com/bplower/connect-snake.git
```

There's an example html file showing how to include the project in it's current state. It's quite messy, but I'm working on cleaning it up.
