# Connect Snake

An implementation of the game Snake inspired by the classic Connect Four game.

## Background

This project was inspired by [this gif](https://imgur.com/gallery/GBrEM) I saw on Imgur the other day. An example of this project in action can be found at http://connect-snake.brahmlower.io.

Frontend development is not my preferred area of software development, so please excuse the horrible javascript. This project was thrown together with no real planning :)


## Building

Run the following to add this to your project:

```
npm install git+https://github.com/bplower/connect-snake.git#how-do-i-npm --save-dev
```

There's an example html file showing how to include the project in it's current state. It's quite messy, but I'm working on cleaning it up.
