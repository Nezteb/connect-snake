# Connect Snake

A family fun game of connecting the dots and building a snake!

## Background

This is the sourcecode for connect-snake.brahmlower.io, a project inspired by [this gif](https://imgur.com/gallery/GBrEM) I saw on Imgur the other day. Frontend development is not my preferred area of software development, so please excuse the horrible javascript. This project was thrown together with no real planning :)

## Building

This was all thrown together super quickly so there's not much to actually build here yet. Just clone the repo and serve the files however you'd like. If you're overwhelmed with all the options, here's a simple one:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
